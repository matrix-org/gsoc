#### Description

[Hookshot](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot) is the matrix.org foundations newest
webhook bridge, which supports multiple different services. It currently supports
a few different things, but we'd like to go further with it.

Some examples might be:
 - [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea)
 - [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)
 - [Google Drive/Docs/Sheets](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/232)
 
Or whatever takes your fancy!
 

#### Milestones

##### GSOC CODING STARTS

* Getting familiar with Matrix, Bridges and the codebase
* Fix a few bugs within hookshot
* Start to build out support for your new service integrations (e.g. push events from Gitea)

##### GSOC MIDTERM

* The bridge should be capable of briding some traffic from the service to Matrix.
* This period should be spent trying to integrate more types of traffic from your services (e.g. release events)

##### GSOC FINAL

* The integration should be feature-complete at this point.
* Some tests should exist for the integration.
* Documentation is solid

##### EXTENSION TASKS

* Build out a [widget interface](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/1.4.0/advanced/widgets.html) for your new service.
