Overhaul of Element web settings

#### Description

It's time to give some needed attention to settings in Element.
You can find them everywhere in the application and are essential to every single
users.

In their current form, settings are very granular and geared towards power users
Following the improvements made to the device list, we want to provide a more 
consistent and pleasant experience for all users.

Settings presets are also an area to explore and apply to the relevant area.
From creating a present for better room creations, to notifications presets many
areas can be improved and simplify the most common use cases we witness in the wild.
