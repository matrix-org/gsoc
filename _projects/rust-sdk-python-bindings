This is an awesome project idea.

#### Description

[matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio) the python library to connect to matrix, lacks some important features - most notably cross-signing-support - that the new [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) supports. This projects want to create python bindings for the Rust SDK and integrate it in the nio library.

#### Milestones

##### GSOC CODING STARTS

* initial Python bindings for Rust SDK

##### GSOC MIDTERM

* Integrating into nio, including encryption support

##### GSOC FINAL

* Fully working nio based on Rust SDK
