<p>You just have to choose a project and write an awesome proposal.
Mentors are set after we choose the projects (which is done by choosing the students).</p>

<p>Our policy is that we’ll always mentor awesome projects, so as long as your proposal
is one of the winning ones, there will be a mentor for the project.
But as for all other projects it might help to talk to your possible mentors, and in
that case it also means trying to maybe find a mentor or at least talk to
devs/maintainers about your ideas possibly on <a href="https://coala.io/chat">gitter</a>.</p>
