  and perfect success?

- Are you already engaged with the project's possible mentors and do
  you have any preference for a particular mentor?
  We will try to get you your first choice for a mentor, usually it will

Other Commitments
-----------------

- Do you have any other commitments during the GSoC period,
  May 27th to August 19th?

    - We don't penalize students for needing adjustments to schedule if
      they're up-front about them and have a plan to mitigate any issues.
      However, we *will* fail students for lying about their availability
      and subsequently falling behind in their work. Be honest!

    - Do you have exams or classes that overlap with this period?

    - Do you have plans to have any other job or internship during this
      period?
        - This is __NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL__ as GSoC is intended to be a
          full time job. But can be worked around if it only a small overlap.

    - Do you have any other short term commitments during this period?
        - e.g. family wedding, conferences, volunteer projects, planned
          vacation days

- Have you applied to any other organizations? If so, to whom and do you have a
  preferred project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one
  org decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
